### Abstract

Style Finder is an open‑source web application that helps young adults discover and refine their personal style without wading through endless product lists. Users complete a brief quiz about color preferences, body shape, and lifestyle, and the platform returns curated outfit suggestions tailored to each profile. A “Trending Now” feed, driven by community votes and real‑time data, keeps recommendations fresh, while quick links to sizing guides and styling tips simplify decision making. Moderated discussion boards allow users to ask questions and share advice, fostering a supportive “style helper” community. By partnering with sustainable brands and ethical influencers, Style Finder not only delivers personalized fashion recommendations but also promotes mindful consumption and waste reduction. 

#### Introduction

Many Gen Z and millennial shoppers know the frustration of ordering clothes online only to find they don’t fit or suit their taste. Traditional fashion sites present massive catalogs or generic suggestions, leaving users overwhelmed. Style Finder addresses this by guiding each user through an intuitive quiz and combining algorithmic recommendations with community feedback. As users answer a few questions, they immediately see outfits that match their profile, and as the community upvotes looks, the feed evolves to highlight both timeless staples and current trends.

#### Key Features and Community Collaboration

Style Finder’s core features include a personalized style quiz, a dynamic product feed ranked by user upvotes, and quick‑access resources such as sizing guides and styling articles. The quiz captures user data—color preferences, body shape, lifestyle—and maps it to curated outfits. The feed surfaces community‑voted looks alongside real‑time trend data, while threaded discussion boards let users ask questions, share tips, and vote on best answers.

**Community Collaboration**
 By hosting the project on GitHub under an open‑source license, developers, UI designers, ethical brands, and micro‑influencers can contribute code, suggest new quiz questions, or submit styling rules. Automated tests and peer reviews ensure quality, while clear contributor guidelines maintain consistency. Influencers help curate capsule collections, and “style helpers” moderate forums, creating a vibrant space where newcomers receive guidance from experienced users.

### Conclusion

Style Finder demonstrates how a user‑centered quiz, community‑driven recommendations, and an open‑source model can simplify fashion decisions and promote sustainable habits. By combining personalized guidance with ethical brand partnerships and active forums, the platform reduces decision fatigue and waste. As contributors expand features—such as AR try‑ons, microservices scaling, and new integrations—Style Finder will continue to evolve, empowering users to feel confident in their style choices and fostering an engaged, mindful fashion community.
